# Predicting Employee Attrition: An EDA Perspective
Employee attrition can significantly impact an organization's stability and growth. Understanding the factors contributing to employee turnover is crucial for building effective retention strategies. This dataset provides valuable insights into employees' education details, joining year, city of office, payment tier, age, gender, experience in the current field, and whether they have been kept out of projects for 1 month or more.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to predict whether an employee will leave the company in the next two years. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to uncover patterns and relationships within the data that can help us build a predictive model. This model will not only predict the prospects of future and present employees but also assist in improving employee retention rates.

Why EDA?
Performing EDA on this dataset is crucial as it allows us to:

Identify the most important factors contributing to employee attrition.
Gain insights into patterns and trends that may not be obvious at first glance.
Validate assumptions and check data quality before building predictive models.
Discover actionable insights that can be used to formulate effective retention strategies.
How EDA Helps
EDA can help us answer important questions such as:

Which factors are most strongly correlated with employee attrition?
Are there any patterns or trends in employee turnover based on education, city, or experience?
How do different factors interact with each other to influence attrition rates?
Are there any outliers or anomalies that need to be addressed before building predictive models?
Conclusion
By conducting a thorough EDA, we aim to uncover hidden patterns and insights that can help us build more accurate predictive models. These models can then be used to proactively identify employees at risk of leaving and implement targeted retention strategies. Ultimately, our goal is to create a positive work environment that fosters employee satisfaction and loyalty.
